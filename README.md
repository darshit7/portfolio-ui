# My 🏠 on the ☁️

My personal site on the cloud. Inspired from [Tuan Anh](https://www.leohuynh.dev/)

## Motivation

Have you ever stumbled upon a coding problem, scoured the internet for solutions, and then found yourself diving deep into a rabbit hole of knowledge? If you're anything like me, you know that feeling all too well.

So, why did I decide to start this blog?

> The answer lies in the countless hours spent exploring the vast landscape of programming. From deciphering the intricacies of Python's syntax to building robust backend systems, every line of code has been a step forward in my journey. But as I delved deeper, I realized something profound — learning is most fulfilling when shared.

Thorugh this blog, I aspire to cultivate curiosity, foster connection and empower learning. Knowledge is not a finite resource; it's a flame that grows brighter with every mind it ignites. Together, let's navigate the twists and turns of technology and emerge not just as skilled developers, but as passionate advocates for learning and growth. 🍻
